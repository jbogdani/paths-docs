Welcome to the [PAThs](http://paths.uniroma1.it) documentation repository, which
is still at a **very early phase of drafting**. This repository is maintained by Julian Bogdani
[julian.bogdani@uniroma1.it](mailto:julian.bogdani@uniroma1.it) and is released
under:  
[![CC BY-NC-SA](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png) Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

As soon as new documentation is being made available by PAThs’ team, it will immediately
be added and published here (source code in
[Markdown format](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)) and in our web site,
[paths.uniroma1.it](http://paths.uniroma1.it) (PDF format).

A PDF version is automatically exported from the [Markdown format](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
and is available and [can be downloaded here](https://github.com/paths-erc/docs/tree/master/Pdf).

**Please refer always to this online version and consider the PDF version as a secondary not always up to date source.**

You are warmly invited to report any inconsistencies, errors, or
typographical misprints by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/paths-erc/paths-docs/issues).
