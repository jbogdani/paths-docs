# PATh documentation repository

Welcome to the [PAThs](http://paths.uniroma1.it) documentation repository, which
is still at a **very early phase of drafting**.

All documentation is released under [MIT License](LICENSE.txt)

As soon as new documentation is being made available by PAThs’ team, it will immediately
be added and published here (source code in
[Markdown format](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)) and in our web site,
[paths.uniroma1.it](http://paths.uniroma1.it) (PDF format).

Please do not hesitate to report any inconsistency, error, or
typographical misprint you may notice by opening a new [issue](https://github.com/paths-erc/paths-docs/issues).
