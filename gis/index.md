These pages aim at providing an in-depth description of the GIS that are data currently
being processed by “PAThs” and made freely available, when copyright and license of
the source data permit redistribution.

At present, a great effort is being spent on georeferencing cartographic
material, freely available on the Internet or provided to “PAThs” by its scientific partners.
You are therefore warmly invited to submit or report cartographic sources of any date relating to Egypt
and neighbour areas, that will be promptly georeferenced and made available at this page.

Moreover, a vectorization process, mainly focused on Christian Egyptian religious buildings
(basilicas, churches, chapels, etc.) is ongoing. Such process is still in a preliminary phase of
implementation, but will soon be extended to other legacy data.
Once again, feel free [to report or submit](https://github.com/paths-erc/paths-docs/issues)
copyright free material that can be easily processed and published.

## Spatial reference systems
[Different coordinate systems](http://epsg.io/?q=egypt) are historically being used for Egypt.
The most common are:
- Geographical coordinate system [Egypt 1907 (EPSG:4229)](http://epsg.io/4229)
- Projected coordinate system:
  - [Egypt 1907 / Red Belt (EPSG:22992)](http://epsg.io/22992)
  - [ED50 / UTM zone 36N (EPSG:23036)](http://epsg.io/23036)
  - [WGS 84 / UTM zone 36N (EPSG:32636)](http://epsg.io/32636)
- For the westernmost desert area the following projected systems might be used:
  - [Egypt 1907 / Purple Belt (EPSG:22993)](http://epsg.io/22993)
  - [ED50 / UTM zone 35N (EPSG:23035)](http://epsg.io/23035)
  - [WGS 84 / UTM zone 35N (EPSG:32635)](http://epsg.io/32635)



## Acknowledgments
A very precious source for [free maps (i.e. public domain)](https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/faq.html#3.html) has provided to be the
[Perry-Castañeda Library Map Collection](https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/) of
the Texas University.
In particular, from the Perry-Castañeda library the following series have been downloaded:
- [Series P502, 1:250,000, U.S. Army Map Service, 1954-](http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/ams/north_africa/)
- [1:1,000,000 - Operational Navigation Chart Series U.S. Defense Mapping Agency Aerospace Center](http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/onc/)
- [1:1,000,000 - International Map of the World U.S. Army Map Service](http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/imw/)
- [1:500,000 - Tactical Pilotage Chart Series U.S. National Imagery and Mapping Agency](http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/tpc/)
- [1:500,000 - World Series 1404, Great Britain. War Office and Air Ministry. 1958-](http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/ams/world/)
- [1:250,000 - North Africa Topographic Maps U.S. Army Map Service, Series P502](http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/ams/north_africa)
- [1:100,000 - Egypt Great Britain War Office/U.S. Army Map Service, Series 4085](1:100,000 - Egypt Great Britain War Office/U.S. Army Map Service, Series 4085)

Single maps of different scales, part of the Survey of Egypt series have been kindly
made available by [Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology of the University of Warsaw (PCMA) (Warsaw, Poland)](https://pcma.uw.edu.pl/en/).
Many thanks to [Artur Obłuski](https://pcma.uw.edu.pl/o-nas/pracownicy/artur-obluski/),
the Director of the Research Centre in Cairo, and to his staff who provided courteous help and support.

The georeferencing work would have not been possible without the fundamental help of the GIS
practical laboratories held at [Sapienza University of Rome](http://uniroma1.it).
Many students have dedicated long hours of passionate and patient work to accurately
index, georeference, and process cartographic data.

A special thank goes therefore to our younger collaborators, coordinated by **Paolo Rosati** and **Domizia d'Erasmo**:

- Ilaria Bitti
- Michele d'Agostini
