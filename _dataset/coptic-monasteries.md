A list of Monastic sites in Egypt with full geographic coordinates downloaded from http://www.ambilacuk.com/coptic/gpslist.html and further elaborated. The original source reports that while much effort has gone into checking the GPS coordinates, both on-site and with Google Earth etc., the GPS locations should be used with caution and should be considered as a general guide.
